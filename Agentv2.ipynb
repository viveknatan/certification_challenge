You generally aren’t \\\\neligible for a Special Enrollment Period to sign up for Medicare when that \\\\nCOBRA coverage ends. Go to page 89 for more information about COBRA \\\\ncoverage. To avoid paying a penalty, make sure you sign up for Medicare \\\\nwhen you’re first eligible. If you have retiree coverage, it may not pay for \\\\nyour health services if you don’t have both Part A and Part B.\\\\nExceptional situations for a Special Enrollment Period\\\\nThere are other circumstances where you may be able to sign up for Medicare \\\\nduring a Special Enrollment Period. You may be eligible if you miss an \\\\nenrollment period because of certain exceptional circumstances, like being \\\\nimpacted by a natural disaster or an emergency, incarceration, employer or \\\\nhealth plan error, losing Medicaid coverage, or other circumstances outside \\\\nof your control that Medicare determines to be exceptional.

This may save you time, money, \\\\nand frustration by avoiding repeated tests and appointments. More \\\\ncoordination also helps prevent medical errors and unexpected drug \\\\ninteractions that may happen if one provider isn’t aware of what another \\\\nhas prescribed you.\\\\nImportant! An ACO won’t limit your choice of health care providers. If \\\\nyour doctor or other provider is part of an ACO, you still have the right \\\\nto visit any doctor, hospital, or other provider that takes Medicare at \\\\nany time. \\\\nIn addition, if your primary care doctor participates in an ACO, you may be \\\\nable to get more benefits. For example, in some ACOs, your provider may offer \\\\nmore telehealth services. This means you may be able to get some services \\\\nfrom home using technology, like your phone or a computer, to communicate \\\\nin real time with your health care provider. \\\\nIn addition, a doctor or other provider who is part of an ACO may be able to \\\\nsend their patients for skilled nursing facility care or rehabilitation services \\\\neven if they haven’t stayed in a hospital for 3 days first, which is usually a \\\\nrequirement in Medicare. For you to qualify for this benefit, your doctor or \\\\nother provider has to decide that you need skilled nursing facility care and \\\\nmeet certain other eligibility requirements.\\\\nIf your primary care doctor participates in an ACO and you have Original \\\\nMedicare, you’ll get a written notice and/or find a poster in their office about \\\\ntheir ACO participation.

Here's how COBRA works with Medicare:\\n\\n1. **COBRA and Medicare Costs**: If you are eligible for Medicare and choose COBRA, COBRA may only cover a small portion of your medical costs. You might have to pay most of the health costs out-of-pocket. It's advisable to contact your COBRA plan to understand the specific percentage they cover.\\n\\n2. **Medicare Enrollment**: It's beneficial to sign up for Medicare (especially Part B) immediately to avoid unexpected medical bills. You have an 8-month window after your employment-based coverage ends to enroll in Part B without a late enrollment penalty.\\n\\n3. **Special Enrollment Period for Part D**: If your COBRA coverage includes creditable prescription drug coverage, you will have a Special Enrollment Period to enroll in Medicare drug coverage (Part D) after your COBRA coverage ends without facing a penalty.\\n\\n4. **Special Enrollment Periods**: COBRA is not considered coverage based on current employment, so you generally don't qualify for a Special Enrollment Period to sign up for Medicare when your COBRA ends.\\n\\nFor personalized assistance, you can reach out to your State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP) or contact the Benefits Coordination & Recovery Center.\", additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 284, 'prompt_tokens': 4375, 'total_tokens': 4659, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_d8864f8b6b', 'id': 'chatcmpl-BWpvDaEZEmjwUy74ucgy4zk0fvgno', 'service_tier': 'default', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run--53e89613-5a11-460b-bb15-c887d3f534d4-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 4375, 'output_tokens': 284, 'total_tokens': 4659, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}})]\n"
