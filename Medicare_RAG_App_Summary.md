# Medicare RAG Application: Project Overview & Code Review

## üîç Problem Statement
Navigating Medicare is complex. Users struggle with dense documents and unclear eligibility or enrollment details. This application solves that by providing a natural language interface to Medicare knowledge based on official documents.

## üë• Target Users
- **Medicare Beneficiaries & Caregivers**: Want simple answers about plans, costs, and enrollment.
- **Customer Service Agents**: Need fast, reliable Medicare info during calls.

## üí° Solution Summary
A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) app built with Chainlit and LangGraph. It processes user queries, retrieves relevant content from Medicare PDFs, and generates accurate, jargon-free answers using GPT-4o.

## üß± Architecture Overview
- **Frontend**: Chainlit (conversational UI)
- **Orchestration**: LangGraph (retrieval + generation flow)
- **Document Ingestion**: PyMuPDFLoader
- **Text Splitting**: RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter with `chunk_size=750`, `overlap=100`, `length_function=tiktoken_len`
- **Embeddings**: Hugging Face (`vivnatan/snowflake-arctic-embed-l-medicare`)
- **Vector Store**: Qdrant (in-memory)
- **LLM**: GPT-4o (via OpenAI API)
- **Agent Layer**: LangGraph agent with conditional tool invocation

## üß† Agentic Reasoning
Used to:
- Decide when to invoke the document-based RAG tool
- Fall back when no relevant context is found
- Enable multi-turn interactions and extensibility with new tools (e.g., search APIs)

## üìö Data Sources
- `10050-medicare-and-you.pdf` from Medicare.gov
- Embeddings via HuggingFace model
- Optionally: TavilySearchResults and ArxivQueryRun for dynamic content

## üìê Chunking Strategy
- RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter with 750-character chunks and 100-character overlap.
- Token-aware (`tiktoken_len`) for GPT-4 compatibility.
- Chosen for balance between precision and contextual integrity.
